What is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
*virtual computing environment  called as instances.
*preconfigured templates for your imstance known as Amzon machine Images(AMI).
*Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types
*secure login information for your information.
*Storage volume for temporary data that deletes when you stop your instance or terminate your instance, know as instance store volume
*A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups
*Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses
*Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources
*Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)
