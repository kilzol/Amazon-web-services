>Once applied, start the stopped instance - it will now be running on the new instance class you chose.



The instance ID will not change, even though the underlying hardware is changed.
If your instance is running in a VPC and has a public IPv4 address, it will receive a new public IPv4 address but retains its private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses.
If the instance is in an Auto Scaling group, you must suspend Auto Scaling otherwise the stopped instance will be marked as unhealthy and may be terminated before you can resize the instance.
